I am a 4th year at UCLA studying Data Theory. Broadly speaking, my research interests are in network science, nonlinear science, machine learning, and numerical analysis. My ongoing projects include:

- dynamics of games on networks,
- predicting glass viscosity using genetic programming, and
- applying knowledge graphs to EHR data.
