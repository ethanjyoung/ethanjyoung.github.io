I am a first year Statistics PhD student at UCLA. I earned my MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Washington and my BS in Data Theory from UCLA.

I am broadly interested in studying network models and deep learning through the perspective of random matrix theory and free probability. Recently, I have been working on a precise characterization of low-rank behavior in the feature matrices of shallow neural networks trained with one gradient step.

My Erdős number is 4, and the shortest path is given by Paul Erdős — Fan Chung — Andrea L. Bertozzi — Mason A. Porter — Ethan Young.
