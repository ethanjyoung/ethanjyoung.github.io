I am an incoming Statistics PhD student at UCLA. I earned my MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Washington and my BS in Data Theory from UCLA.

My research interests include network analysis, dynamical processes on networks, and graph-based learning methods. Recently, I have been exploring problems in control theory and uncertainty quantification.

My Erdős number is 4, and the shortest path is given by Paul Erdős — Fan Chung — Andrea L. Bertozzi — Mason A. Porter — Ethan Young.
