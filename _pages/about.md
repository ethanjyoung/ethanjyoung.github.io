I am an incoming Statistics PhD student at UCLA. I earned my MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Washington and my BS in Data Theory from UCLA.

My research interests include network analysis, deep learning theory, and kernel methods. Recently, I have been interested in using tools from functional analysis and random matrix theory to characterize how shallow neural networks learn features.

My Erdős number is 4, and the shortest path is given by Paul Erdős — Fan Chung — Andrea L. Bertozzi — Mason A. Porter — Ethan Young.
