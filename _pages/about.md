I am a Master's student at the University of Washington, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics. I earned my BS in Data Theory from UCLA. 

My research interests include network science (dynamical processes on networks), machine learning (graph-based learning, deep learning theory, symbolic regression), and optimal control.

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/CV.pdf" download>CV</a>.
