I am a Master's student at the University of Washington, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics. I earned my BS in Data Theory from UCLA. 

My research interests include network analysis, dynamical processes on networks, and graph-based learning methods. Recently, I have been exploring problems in control theory and uncertainty quantification.
