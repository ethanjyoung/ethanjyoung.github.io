I recently graduated from UCLA studying Data Theory. My research interests generally emerged from my coursework and include network science, nonlinear science, machine learning, and numerical analysis. My ongoing projects include:

- characterizing perturbations for the Kuramoto model on networks and
- predicting glass viscosity using symbolic regression with genetic programming.

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/CV.pdf" download>CV</a>.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, playing games (e.g., table tennis, board games, video games), and watching movies.
