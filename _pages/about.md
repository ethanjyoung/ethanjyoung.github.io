I am a 4th year at UCLA studying Data Theory. My research interests generally emerged from my coursework and include network science, nonlinear science, machine learning, and numerical analysis. Fields / topics I would like to do work in include toplogical data analysis, mean field games (and applications), and manifold learning. My ongoing projects include:

- dynamics of games on networks,
- predicting glass viscosity using genetic programming, and
- applying knowledge graphs to EHR data.

Outside of academics and research, I enjoy cooking, playing games (e.g., table tennis, board games, video games), and watching movies.
