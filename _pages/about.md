I recently graduated from UCLA studying Data Theory. My research interests generally emerged from my coursework and include network science, nonlinear science, machine learning, and numerical analysis. My ongoing projects include:

- approximating the effects of network perturbations,
- predicting glass viscosity using genetic programming, and
- applying knowledge graphs to EHR data.

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/cv_feb_2023.pdf" download>CV</a>.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, playing games (e.g., table tennis, board games, video games), and watching movies.
