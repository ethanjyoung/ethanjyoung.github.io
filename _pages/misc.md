# Graduate Course Projects (UW)

* **AMATH 590**: Topics in Random Matrix Theory and High Dimensional Probability

  - I discussed a paper that used random matrix theory to study polynomial graph neural networks. Here is the [slide deck](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/amath_590_slides.pdf). Here is the [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/amath_590_report.pdf).

# Undergraduate Course Projects (UCLA)

* **MATH 42**: Introduction to Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling: Life, the Universe, and Everything

  - My group worked on the 2021 MCM Project A (Fungus). Here is our [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989451/math_42_project.pdf).

* **MATH 148**: Experience of Data Science

  - My group performed data engineering and data analysis with a dataset from Fingerhut. We also communicated our findings to them, which is contained in a <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/math_148_report.pdf" download>report</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/math_148_slides.pdf" download>slides</a>.

* **MATH 168**: Introduction to Networks

  - My group worked on a disease-protein-document network analysis. Here is our [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989458/math_168_project.pdf), [repository](https://github.com/irsyadadam/Analysis-of-CVD-subtypes-using-Random-Projections-Clustering), and <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/math_168_slides.pdf" download>slides</a>.

* **STAT 147**: Data Technologies for Data Scientists

  - I gave a brief overview of federated learning, its applications, and recent advances in the field with this [slide deck](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/fedlearn.pdf).

* **STAT 184**: Societal Impacts of Data

  - I wrote a brief [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989459/stats_184_project.pdf) surveying methods addressing sample selection bias.
