## Nonlinear feature learning in shallow neural networks
With Guido Montúfar and Rishi Sonthalia
  * Neural networks (NNs) are widely used, but the reasons behind their success are still active areas of research. The line of research we are interested in explores how the early phase of gradient descent leads to feature learning. I have looked at low-rank behavior in the gradients of the training loss for various parametrizations (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522)) of two-layer neural networks in the proportional scaling regime. I have found [these](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01445) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01303) to be particularly helpful.
