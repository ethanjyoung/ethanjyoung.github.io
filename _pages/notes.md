# Undergraduate Course Projects

* **MATH 42**: Introduction to Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling: Life, the Universe, and Everything

  - My group worked on the 2021 MCM Project A (Fungus). Here is our [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989451/math_42_project.pdf).

* **MATH 148**: Experience of Data Science

  - My group performed data engineering and data analysis with a large dataset from an industry partner.
  - We also communicated our findings to them, which is contained in this report.

* **MATH 168**: Introduction to Networks

  - My group worked on a disease-protein-document network analysis. 
  - Here is our [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989458/math_168_project.pdf), [repository](https://github.com/irsyadadam/Analysis-of-CVD-subtypes-using-Random-Projections-Clustering), and <a href="https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/raw/master/files/math_168_slides.pdf" download>slides</a>.

* **STAT 147**: Data Technologies for Data Scientists

  - A [slide deck](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989460/fedlearn.pdf) overviewing federated learning, its applications, and recent advances in the field.

* **STAT 184**: Societal Impacts of Data

  - A brief [report](https://github.com/ethanjyoung/ethanjyoung.github.io/files/9989459/stats_184_project.pdf) surveying methods addressing sample selection bias.
